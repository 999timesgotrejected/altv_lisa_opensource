# LISA-srv
altV life in san andreas server

npm i mysql
npm i sjcl

you need a form for mysql database, i used mariadb. 
in root folder (02-09-2019_testDB.sql) is a db backup with password hashes and emails removed.
navigate to LISA-server-opensource\resources\lisa_dbstore\server\startup.mjs and set database password & information.

please note this is OLD and outdated. not tested with latest version.
last tested and working with altv version server BETA build #760.

releasing this as a sort of template or if you just looking at code to learn.
this is VERY alpha and unfinished code. some or most of the code is horribly written.
