# LISA-srv
altV life in san andreas server

npm i mysql
npm i sjcl

you need a form for mysql database, i used mariadb. 
in root folder (02-09-2019_testDB.sql) is a db backup with password hashes and emails removed.
navigate to LISA-server-opensource\resources\lisa_dbstore\server\startup.mjs and set database password & information.

I offer zero support for this, you need some programming knowledge.

please note this is OLD and outdated. not tested with latest version.
last tested and working with altv version server BETA build #760.

releasing this as a sort of template or if you just looking at code to learn.
this is VERY alpha and unfinished code. some or most of the code is horribly written.

here are a few videos of this code in use: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvCT_CWbi5CqLIfrdN6pDg
